        <p class="prose">A few years ago, I <a href="http://poly-graph.co/shorty.html">researched</a> the musical origin story of the word &ldquo;shorty.&rdquo; Turns out that Too $hort was the first to rap it and Lil Jon coined the Southern-drawled “shawty.”
        </p>
        <p class="prose">Shorty wasn’t pervasive, however, until 50 Cent intro’d <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qm8PH4xAss">In Da Club</a> with <i>“Go shorty. It’s your birthday.”</i>

      <div class="prose-wrapper">
        <p class="prose">50 Cent, arguably, made “shorty” mainstream slang.
        </p>
        <p class="prose">Identifying this moment was fascinating: the <b>tipping point</b> for when slang reaches the masses. If 2015 was the year of “netflix and chill” and 2014 was “on fleek,” what slang tipped in 2016?
        </p>
        <p class="prose">Using Google searches for words’ definitions, I examined <b>slang that was once rarely searched, but is now relatively popular.</b> Here’s what blew up last year.

      <p class="prose">This list excludes proper nouns and acronyms (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1reOFVs8RRCq06ZKXpXegFxlRw45B7wapJfrmz22q5gQ/edit">full list here</a> if you’d like to battle linguistics). To remove words attached to the news cycle, I filtered for terms that consistently rose in popularity throughout the year (which excludes terms such as “electoral college,” which spiked suddenly in November).
      </p>
      <p class="prose">If you’re over 25 years-old, you might have no idea what these words mean (or didn’t realize that their usage has evolved, like with “triggered”). While they’ve “tipped,” they’re still emerging words and are becoming increasingly popular at a rapid trajectory. Since I can decipher most of the slang from 2013 - 2015, perhaps 2016’s words need a few more months to spread before reaching elder Millennials and Gex X’rs.
      </p>
      <p class="prose">Why did these words have an “In Da Club” moment and surge in popularity? I did some digging on 2016’s slang; here are three obvious catalysts:
      </p>
      <p class="prose-header">Catalyst 1: Hip Hop with slang as the title</p>
      <p class="prose">Three of 2016’s top slang are clearly the exhaust of hip hop. There’s a long history of hip hop and slang:  pre-Internet, it was arguably one of the richest transcriptions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American_Vernacular_English">African American Vernacular English</a> (the source for copious English slang). Let’s examine the songs responsible for each word.
      </p>
      <p class="prose-def">Broccoli (noun) - weed
      </p>
      <p class="prose">Props to rapper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.R.A.M.">D.R.A.M.</a>: he single-handedly transformed “broccoli” into popular slang (#4 on 2016’s list). Since DRAM released the the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K44j-sb1SRY">“Broccoli”</a> in April 2016, searches for the word’s definition have climbed to about 75% of where “Netflix and chill” peaked in 2015.
      </p>
      <p class="prose">Check out the growth for <span class="red-line">"Broccoli" in the red line below.</span>

    </div>
    <div class="prose-wrapper">
      <p class="prose">It’s worth noting that D.R.A.M. did not coin “broccoli” as slang; E-40 <a href="http://www.xxlmag.com/video/2016/12/e-40-speaks-up-broccoli-slang/">used it</a> at least 10 years prior. But as with 50 Cent and “shorty”, D.R.A.M. pushed the word into mainstream English.
      </p>
      <p class="prose-def">Juju (noun) - a dance
      </p>
      <p class="prose">“Juju on That Beat” by Zay Hilfigerrr has over 100 million streams <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1lItf5ZXJc1by9SbPeljFd">on Spotify</a>. “Juju” <a href="https://genius.com/Zay-hilfigerrr-juju-on-that-beat-tz-anthem-lyrics">refers</a> to a dance, so linguists could argue that it’s a proper noun and not slang (but then what is “twerking”?). That said, it’s #3 on 2016’s list, a testament to hip hop’s effect on language.
      </p>
      <p class="prose-def">Wavy  - (adj.) progressive, cool, swag, well-dressed
      </p>
      <p class="prose">“Wavy” as been around for many years, but only recently surged by popularity. All signals suggest that Ty Dolla $ign’s track “Wavy” was the cause, which dropped in early 2016 at the exact moment the word began to emerge in popularity (though it had been locally popular in Virginia well beforehand).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="geo-frame">
      <iframe width="100%" height="100%" src='https://googletrends.github.io/year-in-language/geo_blog.html' frameborder='0'></iframe>
    </div>
    <div class="prose-wrapper">
      <p class="prose">Ty Dolla $ign’s “Wavy” was never that popular (it didn’t even chart), and searches for wavy’s definition to continue to grow. So unlike “In Da Club,” Ty’s track was a spark for the word to spread. For all the kids using “wavy,” few probably know its roots (Max B. coined it) or that Ty Dolla $ign has any role its recent popularity.
      </p>
      <p class="prose-header">Catalyst 2: Politics</p>
      <p class="prose">In the US, last year’s political circus tipped five of 2016’s list of slang into the mainstream.
      </p>
      <p class="prose-def">Woke (noun) - aware of (racial) social injustice
      </p>
      <p class="prose">“Woke” is the one term on 2016’s list that’s been growing organically for at least a decade. There was no major event that propelled it into the spotlight – it just finally crossed the threshold of mainstream use.
      </p>
      <div class="prose-image">
        <div class="img-wrapper woke-line">
          <img src="woke.png" alt="">
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="prose">There were some unique events in 2016 for “woke.” In terms of semantics, there’s the notion that 2016’s US election cycle whitewashed the term. Today, I see it used broadly as “political awareness,”, beyond its historic racial connotations. Childish Gambino’s “Red Bone” helped too (~50M streams on Spotify), which dropped in November 2016. Its hook repeats “stay woke” and easily helped normalize the phrase.
      </p>
      <p class="prose">Geographically, you’ll find “woke” in liberal-leaning blue-states, such as Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, and California. Relative to other states, folks in the south (specifically South Carolina and Arkansas) are falling behind on the “woke” trend.

      <p class="prose-def">Triggered (verb) - “Getting filled with hate after seeing, hearing or experiencing something you can't stand.” (via <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Triggered">Urban Dictionary</a>)
      </p>
      <p class="prose">The word “triggered” has existed for years in psychology, short for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_trigger">“trauma triggers”</a> (e.g., a veteran hearing gunshots who also suffers from PTSD). Recently, this evolved into the politically divisive “trigger warnings” for books, films, discussion, which may trigger similar distress.
      </p>
      <p class="prose">Triggered has now evolved into a quasi liberal-directed insult, effectively meaning “emotional meltdown.” For example, <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/11/09/triggered-students-across-country-melt-down-in-response-to-trump-victory/">this Breitbart headline</a> following Trump’s election victory, “<b>Triggered</b> Students Across Country Melt Down in Response to Trump Victory.”
      </p>
      <p class="prose-def">Gaslighting (verb) - distorting/disputing facts and events
      </p>
      <p class="prose">The etymology of “gaslighting” begins with the 1938 play “Gas Light.” For several decades, it typically referred to a form <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting">domestic emotional abuse</a> where the victim is given false information so that they question their own memory and reality.
      </p>
      <p class="prose">The word’s recent prominence is due to its use surrounding Trump’s use of facts (i.e., alternative facts, fake news, post-truth) or conflicting versions of events (e.g, the inauguration crowd size). “Gaslighting” is now a <a href="http://www.teenvogue.com/story/donald-trump-is-gaslighting-america">liberal critique</a> of Trump’s disagreement with the media over “what happened” versus “what didn’t.”
      </p>
      <p class="prose-def">Bigly (adj.) - big time
      </p>
      <p class="prose">During the US presidential debates, Donald Trump’s use of “big league” was heard as “bigly,” thus creating a meme and new word for both anti- and pro-Trump supporters.
      </p>
      <p class="prose-def">SJW (noun) - Social Justice Warrior
      </p>
      <p class="prose">SJW is an acronym for social justice warrior. It is now a derogatory term, often wielded against liberals. Here’s a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=SJW">great Urban Dictionary entry</a>, “someone who repeatedly and vehemently engages in arguments on social justice on the Internet, often in a shallow or not well-thought-out way, for the purpose of raising their own personal reputation.” Similar to “woke,” it’s been slowly growing organically, and the 2016 election cycle likely tipped it over the threshold for mainstream use.
      </p>
      <p class="prose">Among political words, it’s also one of the “newest slang” on 2016’s list.

      <p class="prose">And because of its liberal nature, we can see it growing in left-leaning states such as Oregon and Vermont.

      <p class="prose-header">Catalyst 3: Internets</p>
      <p class="prose-def">Dank Meme (noun) - a (ironically) high-quality meme.
      </p>
      <p class="prose">The etymology of “dank meme” is complex, though Reddit is where it initially found momentum. What’s important is that it spread beyond the underbelly of Reddit sometime last year. While “dank” was initially used ironically, it’s now taken literally as “high-quality” by a more basic audience.
      </p>
      <p class="prose-def">Holosexual (noun) - strong attraction to holographic objects
      </p>
      <p class="prose">“Holo” and “Holosexual” took off last year, largely due to YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/simplynailogical">Simply Nailogical</a>’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxUnwCziDso">obsession</a> with holographic nail art.
      </p>
      <p class="prose-header">Unknown (help needed!)</p>
      <p class="prose">I’m unable to find the causes for the popularity of three words.
      </p>
      <p class="prose-def">Boolin (verb) - chilling
      </p>
      <p class="prose">The origin of “boolin” is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloods">Bloods</a>’ habit of replacing c’s with b’s (cool becomes bool). I found use of “boolin” by rapper YG <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPsrqXSyceg">going back to 2012</a>. What’s interesting is the word’s recently growth is firmly rooted in the South.

          <img src="boolin_geo.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="prose">The problem is that I can’t figure out why. Atlanta-based rapper Young Thug <a href="https://twitter.com/youngthug/status/205042307911794688?lang=en">uses</a> <a href="https://genius.com/10290480">“boolin”</a> <a href="https://genius.com/Young-thug-best-friend-lyrics">quite</a> <a href="https://genius.com/Young-thug-power-lyrics">often</a> is his music, but I can’t image this is the reason for the recent growth (and national spread) of the word.
      </p>
      <p class="prose-def">Shook (verb) - scared
      </p>
      <p class="prose">Shook has been around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PosV5zVNWlc">for decades</a>. Yet for some reason, the word blew up in California this summer.
